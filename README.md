# STRASSEN-S-MATRIX-MULTIPLICATION

STRASSEN'S MATRIX MULTIPLICATION using 4 Rows and 4 Columns Elements

using C program I have created Strassen's Matrix Multiplication using 4*4 Elements

Install Turbo C in your Device and run the code
In cmd:
>gcc -v
>cd Desktop(location of file)
>gcc smm.c
>Enter the 4 elements of first matrix: 1 3 7 5 The first matrix is 
1 3 
7 5 
>Enter the 4 elements of second matrix: 6 7 3 8 The second matrix is 
6 7 
3 8 
>After multiplication using Strassen's algorithm  
15 31 
57 89
